# Propagation-Loss-Models
Comparison of empirical propagation path loss models with NS-3 simulator. Based on the paper ["Comparison of Empirical Propagation Path Loss Models for Mobile Communication" by Michael Mollel and Dr. Michael Kisangiri](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266386690_Comparison_of_Empirical_Propagation_Path_Loss_Models_for_Mobile_Communication).

## How to use
1. Put all source files for the propagation loss models (\*\*-propagation-loss-model.\*\*) in $NS3/src/propagation/model directory
2. Put empirical-comparison.cc in $NS3/scratch directory
3. Run empirical-comparison.cc with Waf
